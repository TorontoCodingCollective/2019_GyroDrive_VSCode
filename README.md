<h1>2019_GyroDrive_VSCode</h1>
<p>Gitter: https://gitter.im/torontocodingcollective/GyroDrive
<p>For 2019, WPILib will be moving to Visual Studio Code from eclipse.
<p>
This GyroDrive project for Visual Studio Code uses the Alpha release of the WPILibs as of Oct 2018.  
<p>
The GyroDrive project uses a gyro and a differential drivebase (Left/Right motor drive).  The Toronto Framework is a reference implementation using the Command Based coding paradigm.
<p>
The Toronto Framework adds classed useful when reading a gamecontroller, and shows how to organize the code into OI, Subsystems, and Commands.
<p> This project will continue to be updated as new features are released.  For more information see www.torontocodingcollective.com.
